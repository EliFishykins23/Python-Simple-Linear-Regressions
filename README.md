Simple Linear Regression Model
# Sample size [n = 86]
# This model showcases actual delivery times for sample shipments given the amount in distance from start to end.
# If slope = 0.0045, then for every additional km in distance, delivery time increases by 0.0045 hours (~0.27 minutes) (small fraction of a min.) (~16.2 secs. to be exact).# Python
